	description = The Engineering Department at DKTC, happy with their new office and pay raise, strived to find a new way to remind their boss of the success of this department, and to possibly get another raise, decided to listen to the customer complaints hotline. After listening to hours upon hours of complaints, they picked up a patern.  The small scale rocketeers found the BH Main series too large. The Engineering Department swiftly started work on a small and medium scale versions of the series. This is the 2.5m solution to the BH001.
