	description = One day while Daquan Kerman was working on his Experimental Black Hole Drive, he failed miserably, creating a fuel tank instead. He soon realized that this fuel tank was holding way more fuel than should be possible. Hoping that it would return the fuel put into it, he created the BH001 Black Hole Tank.  Unfortunately, due to its shape, it happens to be an aerodynamic nightmare, as well as retaining all the mass of the copious amounts of fuel. Requiring power to keep the fuel accessible, he relized that it only made sense for large surface bases and refueling stations, and began marketing immediately.
