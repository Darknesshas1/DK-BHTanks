	description = One day, While Daquan Kerman was working on his new Experimental Engine, The Black Hole Drive, accidentally failed miserably, instead making a fuel tank. He soon realized that this fuel tank was holding way more fuel than should be possible. He took this new tank, and hoping that it would return the fuel put into it, Succeeded in creating the BH001 Black Hole Tank.  Unfortunately, Due to its shape, it happens to be an aerodynamic nightmare. The other difficulty's with the tank, it retains all of its mass, and requires power to keep its fuel accessible. he soon realize it would work well for Planetary bases and refueling stations, and began marketing immediately.
