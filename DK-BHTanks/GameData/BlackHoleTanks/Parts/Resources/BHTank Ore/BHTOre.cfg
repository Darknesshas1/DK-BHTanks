Daquan also wondering this, headed out to the back of his office to the original BH Tank, Decided to throw a rock into it and see what happened. Surprisingly, it went in. Daquan, borrowing a truck from one of his employees, decided to see how much would fit, and again found it held way more than an object its size should. He quickly patented the BH002 Ore Tank, bought that employee 3 brand new trucks, and began selling again.
