DarknesshasLost and Benjamin Kerman's Black hole tank mod for KSP
## What does it do?
Black Hole Tanks adds new tanks that store 10x the amount of fuel per space. However, the only way to reclaim the fuel is to reduce the size of the black hole using Electric Charge. The amount needed varies among the tanks, but it is around 60 for the large tanks and 30 for the small tanks.   
The development thread on the forum can be found [here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/158709-wip122black-hole-tanks-mod/#comment-3009527). There is not an official release yet, but we are working very hard to get a stable, working plugin for this mod.   
## How does it work?
You must supply EC to the black hole to be able to access the fuel. This is done through the right-click menu. You can also refuel the tank without having to use EC, the idea being that the black hole is always active, and the EC is just to contain it. You can use this future to pump fuel in.
